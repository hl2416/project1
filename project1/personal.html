        <p class="text">
          I am more of an indoor type of person and would usually be working on my laptop. I do enjoy occasionally hanging out with friends outside.

        <h3> Clubs </h3>
        <p class="text">
          I am not currently in any clubs but I was in the Chess and Badminton club back in high school. Chess club was a club where you just casually play some chess with others. It wasn't
          a competitive club and was just for enjoyment. The Badminton club was the same except with more energy and provided greater enjoyment for me than the chess club usually.
        </p>
        <h3> Hobbies </h3>
        <p class="text">
          I am usually seen reading or playing games when not doing work. I read anything that manages to catch my attention on the web although I mostly read fictional stories which is
          essentially a new world to dive into. As for games, I play single player games and occasionally multiplayer. I don't really enjoy competing extremely hard against others so I
          play casually.
