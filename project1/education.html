        <h3> Brooklyn Technical High School </h3>
        <p class="text">
          While at Brooklyn Tech I was part of the Chess and Badminton clubs. Brooklyn Tech is the only specialized high school in New York City to have majors and I was actually a part of
          the software engineering major where I first learned some programming languages such as Java and Python.

        <p class="text">
          Currently, I am not a part of any clubs at RIT and am not planning on joining any yet although I do check on the Game Development club from time to time. I am still contemplating
          on what my immersion would be. My expected graduation is in 2023.
